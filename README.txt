Gameplay
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jump on to http://safari.memeschemes.com/ and enter your username. You'll be
dropped in to the Safari! with any other connected users. The winner is the
hunter who kills the last Dodo! Use the arrow keys to turn/move and spacebar to
shoot. 


Implementation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We used Node.js on the server and jQuery in the browser. A single server thread
receives all controls input from each player and calculates the evolution of
state. You can get the entire game (server and client) from:
